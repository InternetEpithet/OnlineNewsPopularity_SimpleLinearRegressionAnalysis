# Simple-Linear-Regression
This was a group project for my course STAC67, Regression Analysis, a third year course at UofT. 

This course was taken in the Winter of 2022. For this project I was primarily responsible for model diagnosis and validation. 

Model creation and putting everything together into a presentable piece was not my primary responsibility. 

I will nevertheless provide a copy of the final project in its pdf and powerpoint forms. Please note that the powerpoint has been formatted and is not a direct output from R.
